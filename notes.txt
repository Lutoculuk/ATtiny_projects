* PLL must be restarted after waking up from power-down (ATtiny25/45/85 and probably all others).

* Don't enable an interrupt without writing code for it. It gets mapped to "bad interrupt" --> reset.
  Behaviour can be set with "ISR(BADISR_vect) {}".

  If you just need the interrupt as a wake-up source, use "EMPTY_INTERRUPT(xxx_vect) {}".
  (no pro/epilogue, contains just 'reti').

  This is equivalent:

	ISR(WDT_vect, ISR_NAKED)
	{	
		asm volatile ("reti");
	}

	vs.

	EMPTY_INTERRUPT(WDT_vect)

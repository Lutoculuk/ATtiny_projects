In strict terminology, a pointer to an array of pointers is
TYPE *arr[N];
TYPE *(*ptr)[N];
ptr = &arr;
ptr is a pointer to an array of N pointer to TYPE and points to one
such array.

In this case, ptr[0] is the array itself and ptr[0][i] is the i-th
pointer in the array.

Frequent, as in 99+%, newcomers to the language use the term to mean
TYPE *arr[N]
TYPE **ptr;
ptr =arr; /* or the equivalent ptr = &arr[0]; */
ptr is a pointer to pointer to TYPE and points to the first pointer in
the array of such pointers.

In this case, the slightly simpler ptr[i] is the i-th pointer in the
array.

Which one did you mean?
